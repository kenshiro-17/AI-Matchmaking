Subject: Proof of Talk Internship Case Study Selection - Case Study 3

Hi XVentures Team,

Thank you for sharing the case studies.

I would like to proceed with **Case Study 3: “Design an AI-powered matchmaking tool for Proof of Talk.”**

I’m particularly interested in this case because it sits at the intersection of product strategy, intelligent recommendation systems, and high-trust event operations, which aligns closely with my current work and interests.

I’m attaching my submission package including:
- Level 2: Proof of Concept
- Security Hardening Plan and Implementation
- Level 3: Working Prototype

Best regards,
Rahul
